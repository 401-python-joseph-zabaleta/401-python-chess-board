# Lab: Class 11: Numpy Arrays

## Overview  
This project is about constructing a chess board like its 1980. No prebuilt images just the power of arrays and pixel art.

## Feature Tasks and Requirements  
Your job is to render out chess boards with red and blue queens on them.

Chess board is an 8 by 8 grid of alternating black and white squares. The queens are red and blue squares.

Each board will have one red and one blue queen at different coordinates. In addition to displaying the board you’ll need to identify if the queens are “under attack” based on their coordinates.

## User Acceptance Tests  
- [ ] Queens on the same row should be "under attack".  
- [ ] Queens on the same column should be "under attack".  
- [ ] Queens on the same diagonal should be "under attack".  
- [ ] Queens with any other coordinates should NOT be "under attack".  

## Dependencies
